        <p>Obrisk is a location-based platform where you will find Classifieds, events, jobs, and many more posts based on your location. 
          obrisk.com is a free classified ads website for almost everything. Find what you're looking for or create your own ad for free! </p>

        <p> This project is based upon the use of advanced web technologies to provide robust solutions to challenges 
            of sharing and connection that are lacking in other widely used social networks. Currently, we are focusing on foreigners 
            living in China, giving them a powerful platform where they can share, relate and help one another to overcome different
            problems that foreigners in China face, mostly because of a wide range of cultural differences and language barrier.
        </p>

        <p> Obrisk was founded in 2018 by a very small team of passionate software developers in China. We are working so hard to make
            this platform the best place ever for foreigners in China. 
            This project is still under development and we will truly appreciate any feedback, suggestions or other contibutions.</p>
        <p> Please send your feedback to the development team, just <a href="mailto:contact@obrisk.com" > click here to email us </a></p>

        <p> We are also actively looking for experienced professionals in the software related fields, that are willing to work in a startup. 
            We will prefer the people that are living in China.
            If you think that you are one then you are very welcomed. Please send us your resume/CV <a href="mailto:hr@obrisk.com" > here. </a> </p>
