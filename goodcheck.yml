#This is useful when we are refactoring

#in our codebase

rules:
  - id: AnExample
    pattern: regex-that-is-bad
    message: |
      This too is an example of the message that the developer
      should see when above pattern is detected on the code
      and the build will fail
    justification:
      - The bad regex can be allowed in these conditions
    pass:
      - regex-that-is-very-good-is-like-this
    fail:
      - regex-that-is-bad-should-be-catched

  - id: obdevcheck26032001
    pattern: cdnjs.cloudflare.com
    message: |
      The calls to cloudflare CDN sometimes are too slow
      and they block the whole DOM execution
    pass:
      - "{% static 'js/sdk.min.js' %} type='text/javascript'"
    fail:
      - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/aws-sdk/2.642.0/aws-sdk.min.js
