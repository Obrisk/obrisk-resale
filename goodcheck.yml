#This is useful when we are refactoring
#And there are certains names or pattern we don't want
#in our codebase

rules:
  - id: obdev201801
    pattern: regex-that-is-bad
    message: |
      This too is an example of the message that the developer
      should see when above pattern is detected on the code
      and the build will fail
    justification:
      - The bad regex can be allowed in these conditions
    pass:
      - regex-that-is-very-good-is-like-this
    fail:
      - regex-that-is-bad-should-be-catched
